# MNIST-Data
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digits, commonly used for training and testing image classification models.
We are utilizing this dataset to develop and refine machine learning algorithms for digit recognition, focusing on improving accuracy and model performance. Our approach involves preprocessing the images, implementing various classification algorithms, and evaluating their effectiveness in identifying handwritten digits.
